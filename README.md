I have been developing professionally for over 15 years now. I got hooked with my old Commodore 64 when I was 6 years old and never stopped. I jumped form technology to technology and from language to language.
I am the kind of developer that likes to polish an algorithm to perfection just to shave a few milliseconds (and learn something in the process).
Lately I have been more an Architect than a developer, looking at the big picture, but I never left the code behind. I still code and want to keep learning as long as there is something else to learn.
